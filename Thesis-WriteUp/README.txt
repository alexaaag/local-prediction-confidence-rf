FIRST

1. Make sure your .tex file and the pom_thesis.cls (AND the logo: pomonalogo.pdf) all live in the same folder.

2. If you want to run the sample file, you also need to download either (thesis_test.tex AND templatefig1.pdf) or (thesis_test_wbibtex.tex AND templatefig1.pd AND thesis_test_bib.bib).




To use thesis_test.tex  (without using BibTeX, bibliography is a the end of the .tex file)

* Simply fill in the appropriate content (name, title, abstract, text, etc.).  

* LaTeX the file, thesis_test.tex.  You may have to run LaTeX (and BibTeX) a few times to make sure that table of contents and bibliography appear properly.

* You probably want to rename the file for your own sake.



To use thesis_test_wbibtex.tex (using BibTex, bibliography is in a separate file)

*  Create your own bibliography file (in the test template the bibliography file is called:  thesis_test_bib.bib)

* Simply fill in the appropriate content (name, title, abstract, text, etc.).  

* LaTeX the file, thesis_test.tex.  You may have to run LaTeX (and BibTeX) a few times to make sure that table of contents and bibliography appear properly.

* You probably want to rename the file for your own sake.
